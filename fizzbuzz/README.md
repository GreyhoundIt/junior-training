## Fizzbuzz is a game that takes a number and outputs a string or number depending on the value

### Rules
1. If the number can be divided by 3 then output Fizz
2. if the number can be devided by 5 then output Buzz
3. If the number can be divided by 15 then output Fizzbuzz
4. If none of the above output the number as a string. e.g '1'

#### Instructions
1. Make a class with a method that takes a integer and returns a string according to the above rules 
2. Make a game method that takes a min and max number and returns a string according to the above rules e.g "1,2,Fizz"
3. Using your knowledege of hashes make a method that we can use to replace the numerical values to the word equiverlent e.g "One,Two,Fizz"
4. Make a new method that instead of returning a string as in instruction 2 we return a Hash with eg { '1' => '1', '2' = '2', '3' => 'Fizz' }

5. If you get time could you write tests for these
